# 🛍️ Retail Sales EDA – McDonald’s Nutrition Dataset

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for **Task 1** of the Oasis InfoByte Data Analytics Internship.

## 📌 Objective

Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of nutrition facts from McDonald's menu items to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can inform business decisions.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – McDonald's Nutrition Facts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts)

   - Renamed columns for clarity

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation
   - Identified high-calorie and high-sugar items

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Bar plots: Calories by category
   - Heatmaps: Nutrient correlation matrix
   - Histograms: Distribution of calories and sodium

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Menu categories with the highest calorie and sugar content
   - Nutrients with strong correlations (e.g., fat ↔ calories)
   - Suggestions for healthier menu offerings
